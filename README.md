## 🔹 Detailed Project Description

**AgroSaathi** is an AI-based agricultural assistant designed to support farmers in identifying plant diseases quickly and accurately. Farmers can upload an image of a plant leaf through the chatbot interface, and the system analyzes it using a trained deep learning model.

The core of the system is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on a plant disease dataset. The model classifies the uploaded image into different disease categories or identifies it as healthy. After prediction, the chatbot provides:

* ✅ Disease name
* ✅ Confidence percentage
* ✅ Causes of the disease
* ✅ Recommended treatment methods
* ✅ Preventive measures

The chatbot interface makes the system easy to use, even for non-technical users. It ensures accessibility by providing simple language responses and step-by-step guidance.

### 🔹 Key Features:

* Real-time plant disease detection
* Image upload-based prediction
* Smart chatbot interaction
* Treatment and prevention suggestions
* User-friendly interface
* Fast response time
